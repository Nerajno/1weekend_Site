- [ ] Good Basic ReadMes
- [ ] Tests ?
- [ ] As someone with ADHD, I would have an easier time reading your bio if you emphasised some parts by making them bold. I’d usually suggest subheadings for readability, but that’s not quite right for a bio. Using emphasis is a good alternative.
- [ ] Also re readability, I’d probably make the base font a bit bigger. 10px is awfully small. Especially with a design that is so focused on copy and is very minimalist with almost no visuals.
