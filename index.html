        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently a fullstack developer at Equity Prime Mortgage, serving
          mostly in a devops capacity, while assisting a team of 9 developers
          working on the company's proprietary mortgage web platform. The team
          does a combination of new feature development in a modern Expo React
          Native SPA front-end codebase, creation of a Node.js back end, the
          creation and integration of middleware , and creating new user
          workflows and adding functionality as needed possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously I worked as a QA/Junior Software Engineer at WarnerMedia
          Discovery's Atlanta office, doing Javascript based ad technologies for
          the company's famous brands : Cartoon Network and Adult Swim.
        </p>
        <p>
          In both roles, a large part of my has involved brainstorming,
          untethered problem solving and modifying codebases , and working with
          multiple stakeholders to the work being done is understood and are
          delivering the right solutions. I've also worked to simplify
          documentation, QA and testing strategies thus facilitating best
          practices in the software development life cycle, and worn various
          other hats as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before WarnerMedia Discovery, I interned at Mobile App Hero leaning
          into the Expo React Native and Firebase stack, understanding the
          technical tooling and process required to develop a product, thus,
          bringing value to customers. Other tech based experience include being
          an intern at
          <a href="https://bit.ly/3TvDO0j" target="_new" rel="noopener"
            >Ringer Consulting Group</a
          >
          in 2017, served as an instructor for the introduction to web
          development course for Lighthouse. Most recently, I served as a
          software engineering mentor at Thinkful( a Chegg service), providing
          assistance to students as they complete their journey into software
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have served a volunteer at a number of tech conferences, been a
          co-organizer to FreeCodeCamp Atlanta since 2018. I have been a part of
          a civic hacking project which started at the first MARTA hackathon in
          2016 ( the idea went on to win $40000 in the ATLC3 competition in 2018
          ).
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of being a technologist, I have a lot of interest in cooking,
          art and tinkering. I have a vast array of experience as I have been a
          apprentice farmer, a truck driver, an electronics repair technician
          among other trades. Even though being software engineer is my current
          trade, I have an enormous skills set in terms of learning,
          documentation and best practices as a result of my training as a
          middle school teacher (science and literacy specialization).
